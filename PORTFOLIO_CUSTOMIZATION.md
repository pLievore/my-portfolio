About Section

I am a BI & Analytics Specialist focused on building scalable and governed data platforms.

Currently contributing to the BI structuring of Pluxee Brazil, working with Power BI, Tabular Editor, Azure DevOps, and enterprise semantic modeling.

I design intelligent data models, automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines, and ensure governance through structured version control.

My goal is to transform complex data ecosystems into reliable, scalable, and decision-driven platforms.

I work in agile environments (Scrum and Kanban) with strong ownership and execution mindset.
